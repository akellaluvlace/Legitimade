LegitimaDe – Authenticity You Can Trust
LegitimaDe bridges everyday QR code scanning and blockchain security to create a new era of product
authenticity . With one tap, consumers and brands can scan a product’s QR code and instantly verify its
origin and status. Each product’s identity is anchored on a decentralized, tamper-proof blockchain ledger, so
any attempt to falsify or alter the record is immediately detected . The app then displays a green
checkmark and a “Product is Genuine” message only when the item matches the immutable blockchain
record .
The Challenge of Counterfeits
Counterfeit goods pose a critical threat to both brands and consumers. Fake products – from luxury fashion
to pharmaceuticals – flood global markets, infringing on IP rights and endangering customers with
substandard quality . The scale is staggering: recent reports estimate nearly $100 billion in losses from
counterfeit luxury items alone . In this environment, building trust is essential: brands and buyers need
a reliable way to prove authenticity at the point of purchase.
How It Works
Scan: Use your smartphone to scan the QR code on any product. LegitimaDe then retrieves the
associated blockchain record and verifies it.
Verify: The app compares the scanned code with the blockchain ledger. Because blockchain data is
decentralized and immutable , any mismatch or tampering is instantly detected.
Result: If the record matches, LegitimaDe shows a green checkmark and “Product is Genuine”
message; otherwise it flags the item. This instant verification requires no central database—just the
trust of the blockchain .
For Brands & Consumers
Brands: LegitimaDe offers the highest level of brand protection via blockchain-backed verification
. By embedding each product’s identity on an immutable ledger, brands curb counterfeit sales
and retain customer trust .
Consumers: Shoppers gain confidence and transparency. With a quick scan, they see proof of
authenticity and product provenance, enabling informed buying decisions . The combination
of QR codes and blockchain means anyone can verify genuineness without relying on a central
authority.
